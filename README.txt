Welcome to Space Pong!

Each side is able to fire lasers from their ship. (Left uses space, right uses numpad0)

Each ship has a certain amount of health, everytime it it hits the ball it takes off 1/15th of the total health and height, while lasers do double the damage!

When the total health is depleted, the ship blows up and the opponent wins the game.

Don't let the fireball hit the edges of your ships! itll do MASSIVE damage!

You can only shoot another laser, once the previous one has either hit a target, or missed it completely.

The ball speeds up everytime it hits a paddle.

First to 3!

Things I would implement but don't have enough time.

-tutorial screen
- laser proof shields (doesnt block your own laser)
- powerups (smokescreen, superlaser, machinegun, health)
- Ai (attempts to make itself equal to the x axis of the ball by incrementing by a small amount each time [which gives it humanlike smooth movement] 
	shoots when both x's of ships are lined up.)
